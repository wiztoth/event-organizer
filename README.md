# Event Organizer ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to **Event Organizer**, the app that makes organizing events as easy as pie (or at least as easy as opening two terminal sessions)!

## Getting Started ðŸ“–

To get this project up and running, you'll need to channel your inner multitasker and open **two terminal windows**. Here's the magic formula:

### Terminal 1: The Backend ðŸ‘¾

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2. Install the Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Important!** This backend is powered by Firebase. You'll need to:
    - Create a Firebase project.
    - Download the Firebase credentials JSON file.
    - Place the JSON file in the `backend` directory.
    - VoilÃ ! The backend is now ready to talk to your Firebase database.

4. Run the backend server (you know you want to):
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```

### Terminal 2: The Frontend âœ¨

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install the Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## And That's It!

Now you have both the backend and frontend running like a well-oiled machine. Open your browser, and let the event-organizing fun begin!

If something breaks, don't panic. Just remember: Google is your best friend, and coffee is your second-best friend. Happy coding! ðŸš€
